# Why charger/charging standardisation is important for EV ecosystem.

  

Remember those days where we needed to carry a charger for our mobile phones where ever we travelled, The charge anxiety of phones where real that time. The reason was simple, even though all phones where charged using the same 220v/110v and the output was 5v. The connectors where different. Samsung used their proprietary charger and Nokia used their own and Sony used one which they designed themselves, all these where not compatible to each other. This disparity resulted in lot many brands with lot many types of chargers. This resulted in mobile phone users not sure about whether they will be able to find a suitable connector (not charger) if they forget to carry their own charger. Mobile phone charger adaptors where a common sight those days.

  

The non standard chargers where not seen as a problem then since feature phones where not power hungry and can last days with a single charge. Fast forward to the smart phone era the same situation would have resulted less adoption due to the fact that most smart phone batteries last way lesser than feature phones and the advanced sensors made phone battery last even lesser. One thing over these years changed the way we use our phones is charging of these devices. Companies started using common connectors to the phones. It started with micro usb then USB type C. These changes made sure that users are not worried about getting the phone charged even though they are not carrying a charger. This resulted in more usage of the phone and more features getting used in these devices. Essentially though single connector seems a simple problem to solve, the charge anxiety got vanished away with the charger connector standardisation. Now even governments also understood the significance of the same and the classic ruling against apple using proprietary lighting connector need to be seen in this context.

So Why does this matter for EV ?

  

EV’s are in the same cross road even though India government have standards mandating common connectors to be there in the charging stations, Its important that our EV’s needs to have the same ports across brands and models. This should be the first step to curb charge anxiety. There are many advantages to standardising the chargers.

  

1. Charge any EV at any station.

  

2. Easier charger network growth.

  

3. More sophisticated EV to EVSE communication.

  

4. Less cost to setup EV Charging station.

  

5. Less chances of people making mistakes and damaging connectors of both EVSE or EV’s.

  

The disparity between the chargers is more prominent in the two wheeler segment though people argue that most of the two wheelers can be charged overnight, The fact is that the battery degrades over time and the charging frequency will increase. An increased charging frequency means the EV’s need a rapid top up rather than a long slow charging. All of these will result in two wheelers too coming to the charging station more frequently.

  

The second problem is cost for an EV the major share of and EV is its battery. If we charge a EV at our office or a shopping mall in < 15 mins even a 50 km range two wheeler wont cause charge anxiety(as per stats average kms driven in a two wheeler per day is 12Km in india), But the surety of finding a compatible charger again depends on the number of chargers which have a charger compatible to the two wheeler. This is where PCS( public charging station) plays an important role as making sure that the charger is available for you when and where you need depends on the public charging stations availability.

  

Current scenario a PCS needs to onboard a number of new connectors though connectors are not having a lot of cost, the problem is a charger with two vehicle charging capability wastes one slots due to having difference in connector just like the old days where a phone charging station supports 10 brands of mobile charging at one time but not two phones of the same brand(due to the lack of the connecting pin availability).

  

We are in the start of EV revolution right now, if we dont address the charger compatibility now when we eventually reach there there will be a lot many customers who bought EV in the early days will be left behind and will be struggling to find a compatible charger which will eventually strengthen the thought “This is an new technology let me wait till people use it and then I will” this thought coming to masses will end up in no one using the technology at all.
